# Road Accident Analysis Dashboard | Excel - SQL- Power BI |
~ Project Overview
This project analyzes road accident data to uncover patterns in casualties, accident severity, vehicle types, road conditions and time trends.
I have mad it easier for stakeholders to understand where, when, and why accidents occur and support data-driven road safety decisions.

~ Business Objectives
1. Identify high-risk vehicle types and road types
2. Compare year-over-year accident trends (2021 vs 2022)
3. Analyze urban vs rural and day vs night accident distribution
4. Understand the impact of weather, road surface, and light conditions
5. Provide an interactive dashboard for exploration

~ Tools I Used
SQL (PostgreSQL) – Data cleaning, transformation & analysis
Power BI – Interactive dashboard & visual storytelling
Excel / CSV – Raw dataset handling
GitHub – Version control & documentation

~ Key Metrics
1. Total Casualties: 417,888
2. Fatal Casualties: 7,135 (1.7%)
3. Serious Casualties: 59,312 (14.2%)
4. Slight Casualties: 351,436 (84.1%)
5. Car Involvement: 333,485 casualties (~80%)

~ Key Insights
1. Cars account for ~80% of total casualties, making them the highest-risk vehicle category
2. Single carriageways contribute the highest number of accidents
3. Urban areas (≈62%) report more casualties than rural areas
4. Daytime accidents (≈74%) are significantly higher than nighttime
5. Casualties peak during mid-year and evening hours
6. Most accidents occur on dry roads, followed by wet conditions
7. Year-over-Year Trend (2021 vs 2022)
